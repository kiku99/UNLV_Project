- Period: 2023.06.25 ~ 2023.07.23
- Project: Definition of scaleable machine learning for big data
- Description: Big data analytics provides scalable solutions for distributed or very large data. For this project, students will have hands-on experience installing Apache Spark, and practicing python libraries, e.g., MLLib, while applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to large datasets for data analysis and developing machine learning models.

## Project subject
